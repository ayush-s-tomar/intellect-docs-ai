# AskMyDocs — AI Document Q&A Tool

> Upload any document and ask questions about it. The AI answers strictly from your document and shows exactly which part of the document the answer came from.

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://intellect-docs-ai.vercel.app

## What it does

- 📄 Upload any `.txt` or `.pdf` document
- ✅ Select it from the sidebar
- 💬 Ask any question about it in natural language
- 🤖 Get an AI-powered answer based strictly on your document
- 🔍 See exactly which chunks of the document the answer came from
- 🗑️ Delete documents when no longer needed
- ⚡ Real-time streaming responses powered by Groq

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Frontend | Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| AI / LLM | Groq API (LLaMA 3.1 8B Instant) |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector) |
| Text Search | Supabase full-text search |
| Deployment | Vercel |

## How it works

1. User uploads a document
2. The backend splits it into chunks of ~500 characters
3. Chunks are stored in Supabase with their index
4. When a question is asked, the app searches for relevant chunks using full-text search
5. The top matching chunks are sent to Groq AI as context
6. Groq streams back an answer based strictly on those chunks
7. The UI shows the answer + the source chunks it came from
